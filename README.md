# Diabetes Prediction System 🧠

This project predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes using machine learning. It uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, trained on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn (SVM, train-test split, scaler)

## 📊 Dataset
The model uses the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset** containing features like:
- Glucose level
- Blood Pressure
- BMI
- Age, etc.

## 🧠 ML Approach
- Data preprocessing and scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Train-test split: 80% training, 20% testing
- Model training with **SVM**
- Accuracy and confusion matrix used for evaluation

## 📁 Files
- `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter/Colab notebook with complete code

## ✅ Output
Achieved solid accuracy on the test data. This system can be used for early prediction and healthcare assistance.
